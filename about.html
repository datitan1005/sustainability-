        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Our project focuses on repurposing fruit leftovers to make nutritious fruit smoothies. This initiative not only reduces food waste but also provides healthy options for our community. We believe that small changes in our daily habits can lead to significant improvements in food security and environmental sustainability.</p>
        <p>In addition to making fruit smoothies, we also teach people about the importance of reducing food waste and how they can contribute to zero hunger efforts. We encourage everyone to share their experiences, spread the word, and participate in our mission to eradicate hunger.</p>

        <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
        <p>We took this opportunity to explain the purpose behind our project. We highlighted how SDG#2 aims to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by promoting access to nutritious food for everyone. We also stressed on how small daily decisions can contribute to achieving this global goal.</p>
        <p>During these one-on-one interactions, we shared ideas on how even in their own kitchens they can help support this SDG by reducing waste in their kitchen with activities like cutting and cooking only what is needed.</p>
        <p>Our personal delivery approach proved to be an effective way of fostering deeper connections and making the message more relatable. They valued the effort we put in both preparing the smoothies and educating others about SDG#2. They also expressed that they would try their best to reduce waste and help spread the message further.</p>
        <p>This experience taught us that addressing hunger and promoting food security is not only about providing food but also raising awareness and inspiring others to act. The combination of a simple, enjoyable activity and an important conversation left a lasting impact, reinforcing our belief that everyone has a role to play in achieving a hunger-free world.</p>
